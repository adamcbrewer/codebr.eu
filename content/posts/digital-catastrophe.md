# What To Do In The Event of A Digital Catastrophe
<aside class="post-meta">Adam Brewer &mdash; <time datetime="">xx, 2013</time></aside>

For me, I consider Gmail to be my most crucial account. All of my other online accounts (if I'm being honest) are superfluous waffle. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. are all things I'm not bothered about losing completely, let alone losing access to.

But, let's face it, with all of our laptops, tablets and mobile phones we carry around with us these days, our data – our online persona if you will – more than likely has quite a bit of sensitive information.

Email, internet banking, online accounts; these are things we're probably logged in to across multiple devices. But what happens if you use your mobile phone to access your email on-the-go and you've suddenly just lost it in Waterloo station?

It's not thought about often enough, but knowing what to do in case of such an emergency is critcal. Just think about what kind of information you've exchanged: your passport number, bank account information, passwords…

For Gmail, find a computer somewhere as soon as possible and log in to your Google account. In the bottom right of your inbox (this will more than likely change in the future) will be a link to "Last account activity." Open the dialogue box and sign out of all other active sessions. I'm very pleased at how easy Google makes this process; literally just a click of a button. Now quickly change your password.
